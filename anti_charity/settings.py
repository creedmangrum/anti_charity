# The following code enables the use of personal settings files.
#
# There are two styles, with different purposes and properties:
#
#   dev_settings_<user>.py
#
#     If you use this naming convention, it's recommended that you check
#     your settings file into git, since it will still only be used by
#     you.  Some advantages of checked-in settings are:
#       - They are backed up.
#       - They are versioned.
#       - They are available for team members to use as a reference.
#
#   local_settings.py
#
#     If you use this naming convention, you must NOT check in your
#     settings file, since it would then get checked out by others.
#     Possible advantages of a not-checked-in personal settings file are:
#
#       - They are private (so might more comfortably contain passwords).
#       - They are ephemeral (so can be created/edited/deleted without git)
#
# Note that if you have both in play, the local_settings.py, which is the
# most emphemeral one, is loaded second so it can override the other one,
# which has things that are probably more enduring.
